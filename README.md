#  i-213-analysis

Public analysis of non-sensitive scraped content from ICE/CBP I-213 forms obtained by UWCHR via FOIA lawsuit against DHS.

## Source

I-213 "Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien" forms are generated by ICE and CBP upon apprehension of a subject. Under FOIA, UWCHR requested all I-213s produced by both CBP and ICE in the state of Washington from 2012-2017; when the agencies failed to adhere to the requirements of FOIA — first claiming privacy waivers were needed for every individual form and then claiming that as law enforcement agencies, they were exempt from providing such records — UWCHR sued in September 2018. UWCHR underwent separate settlement negotiations with each subagency. In these discussions, CBP agreed to provide a sample of all documents produced by staff in the agency’s Blaine and Spokane sectors from January 1, 2012 to September 30, 2017, and ICE agreed to provide copies of all documents produced from January 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020 by staff from the agency’s Seattle field office.

## Data scraping

PDF forms delivered by ICE/CBP are parsed, scraped, and cleaned in a separate repository developed by the [Human Rights Data Analysis Group (HRDAG)](https://github.com/HRDAG/) and maintained by UWCHR. Scraping and cleaning code available upon request. Data cleaning is ongoing and dataset in `import/input/` will be updated as new versions become available.

## Non-public data

Dataset in this repo consists of scraped I-213 forms, withholding descriptive "narrative" fields which may contain sensitive information.

## Tasks

- `import/` - Contains public verison of dataset exported from private I-213 scraping repository; contents of `import/input/` are symlinked to `import/output/` 
  - `import/input/uw-chr-i213-public.csv.gz` - Public version of I-213 dataset, compressed pipe-separated (`|`) CSV format.
- `county-pop/` - Downloads county and state population data for per-capita calculations from ACS via `tidycensus`. Requires ACS API key.
- `map/` - Generates I-213 maps and per-capita table used in 2021-08-11 UWCHR report ["Protecting Immigrant Rights: Is Washington’s Law Working?"](https://jsis.washington.edu/humanrights/2021/08/11/protecting-immigrant-rights-is-washingtons-law-working/) 
- `write/` - Descriptive analysis notebooks
- `docs/` - Documentation published at [uwchr.github.io/i-213-analysis/](uwchr.github.io/i-213-analysis/)
